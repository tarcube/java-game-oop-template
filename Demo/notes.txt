The provided code is a simple Java game that uses the Canvas class to draw graphics and handle user input.
 The code is divided into several classes, each with a specific role in the game.


1.
 **Pong class**: This class extends the Canvas class and implements the Runnable interface.
 It is the main class of the game.
 It contains the main game loop and handles the game's rendering and logic updates.
 The `Pong` class creates a `Handler` object, which manages all the game objects.
 The `Pong` class creates a `Window` object, which sets up the game window.
 The `Pong` class also handles the game's threading and provides methods to start and stop the game thread.


2.
 **KeyInput class**: This class extends the KeyAdapter class and handles the game's keyboard input.
 It listens for key press and key release events and updates the game's state accordingly.
 It also plays a sound effect when the space bar is pressed.


3.
 **Handler class**: This class manages all the game objects.
 It contains a LinkedList of GameObject objects and provides methods to add and remove objects.
 It also has methods to update and render all the game objects.


4.
 **Window class**: This class extends the Canvas class and sets up the game window.
 It creates a JFrame, sets its size and location, adds the game canvas to it, and makes it visible.
 It also starts the game thread.


5.
 **GameObject class**: This is an abstract class that represents a game object.
 It contains fields for the object's position, velocity, and ID.
 It also contains abstract methods for updating and rendering the object.


6.
 **Ball class**: This class extends the GameObject class and represents the game's background.
 It overrides the `tick` and `render` methods to update and draw the background.


7.
 **ID enum**: This enum is used to identify the type of a game object.
 In this case, there is only one type of game object: the ball.


In summary, the `Pong` class is the main game loop and handles the game's rendering and logic updates.
 The `KeyInput` class handles the game's keyboard input.
 The `Handler` class manages all the game objects.
 The `Window` class sets up the game window.
 The `GameObject` class represents a game object, and the `Background` class represents the game's background.
 The `ID` enum is used to identify the type of a game object.
